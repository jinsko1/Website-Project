As for the theme specified in the configuration file, I simply built the website off the “lightly” theme.\n\nI hosted the website on GitHub Pages but bought a custom domain, so the DNS records needed to point to four `A` records that connect to GitHub’s servers. From there, a `CNAME` record points to my GitHub Page. Then, all I needed to do was tell GitHub that I had a custom domain ready.\n\nRather than publishing from the `main` branch, I set up a separate branch, `gh-pages`, and published from there. This keeps the repo clean: I can isolate the build artifacts in that branch and deploy from there, relieving the main branch of unnecessary clutter. `_site` is also included in `.gitignore` to reduce clutter on the main branch, ensuring that only actual edits are visible in the version history.\n\nThat concludes the mechanics behind the website. I’m sure I’ve mentioned this on the home page, but this website is primarily a way for me to put what I learn into words, which I hope will aid the learning process. I’ll continue doing this with other subjects of interest.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI used Quarto, which was recommended to me by a friend for its simplicity and ease of management.
