  abstract = {Abstract             Over 50\% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as {$\geq$}2 UTIs in a 6-month period or {$\geq$}3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for ``preference sensitive'' decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.},

  abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is a causative agent in the vast majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs), including cystitis and pyelonephritis, and infectious complications, which may result in acute renal failure in healthy individuals as well as in renal transplant patients. UPEC expresses a multitude of virulence factors to break the inertia of the mucosal barrier. In response to the breach by UPEC into the normally sterile urinary tract, host inflammatory responses are triggered leading to cytokine production, neutrophil influx, and the exfoliation of infected bladder epithelial cells. Several signaling pathways activated during UPEC infection, including the pathways known to activate the innate immune response, interact with calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Some UPEC isolates, however, might possess strategies to delay or suppress the activation of components of the innate host response in the urinary tract. Studies published in the recent past provide new information regarding how virulence factors of uropathogenic E. coli are involved in activation of the innate host response. Despite numerous host defense mechanisms, UPEC can persist within the urinary tract and may serve as a reservoir for recurrent infections and serious complications. Presentation of the molecular details of these events is essential for development of successful strategies for prevention of human UTIs and urological complications associated with UTIs.},

  abstract = {Swarming is a form of surface motility observed in many bacterial species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Here, dense populations of bacteria move over large distances in characteristic tendril-shaped communities over the course of hours. Swarming is sensitive to several factors including medium moisture, humidity, and nutrient content. In addition, the collective stress response, which is observed in P. aeruginosa that are stressed by antibiotics or bacteriophage (phage), repels swarms from approaching the area containing the stress. The methods described here address how to control the critical factors that affect swarming. We introduce a simple method to monitor swarming dynamics and the collective stress response with high temporal resolution using a flatbed document scanner, and describe how to compile and perform a quantitative analysis of swarms. This simple and cost-effective method provides precise and well-controlled quantification of swarming and may be extended to other types of plate-based growth assays and bacterial species.},

Regulation of iron homeostasis thus plays a vital role in almost all living organisms. During the last 15 years, the small RNA (sRNA) RyhB has been shown to be a key actor of iron homeostasis regulation in bacteria. Through multiple molecular mechanisms, RyhB represses expendable iron-utilizing proteins, promotes siderophore production, and coordinates Fe-S cluster cofactor biogenesis, thereby establishing a so-called iron-sparing response. In this review, we will summarize knowledge on how sRNAs control iron homeostasis mainly through studies on RyhB in Escherichia coli. The parallel roles and modes of action of other sRNAs in different bacteria will also be described. Finally, we will discuss what questions remain to be answered concerning this important stress response regulation by sRNAs.},

  abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTI) are highly prevalent, a significant cause of morbidity and are increasingly resistant to treatment with antibiotics. Females are disproportionately afflicted by UTI: 50\% of all women will have a UTI in their lifetime. Additionally, 20-40\% of these women who have an initial UTI will suffer a recurrence with some suffering frequent recurrences with serious deterioration in the quality of life, pain and discomfort, disruption of daily activities, increased healthcare costs, and few treatment options other than long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary causative agent of community acquired UTI. Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) is the most common hospital acquired infection accounting for a million occurrences in the US annually and dramatic healthcare costs. While UPEC is also the primary cause of CAUTI, other causative agents are of increased significance including Enterococcus faecalis. Here we utilize two well-established mouse models that recapitulate many of the clinical characteristics of these human diseases. For UTI, a C3H/HeN model recapitulates many of the features of UPEC virulence observed in humans including host responses, IBC formation and filamentation. For CAUTI, a model using C57BL/6 mice, which retain catheter bladder implants, has been shown to be susceptible to E. faecalis bladder infection. These representative models are being used to gain striking new insights into the pathogenesis of UTI disease, which is leading to the development of novel therapeutics and management or prevention strategies.},

Using gene fusion and exogenously added catalase, we found that LB-Sigma contains higher levels of H2O2 than LB-Difco. Also we observed differences in population counts of 82 clinical and environmental isolates of E. coli, depending on the LB used. Further investigations revealed a significant influence of the commercial origin of agar as well. Besides being a warning to the wide population of LB users, our observations provide researchers in the oxidative stress field with a tool to appreciate the severity of mutations in antioxidative stress defenses.},

We present an electron cryo-microscopy structure of the ABC-type tripartite assembly at near-atomic resolution. A hexamer of the periplasmic protein MacA bridges between a TolC trimer in the outer membrane and a MacB dimer in the inner membrane, generating a quaternary structure with a central channel for substrate translocation. A gating ring found in MacA is proposed to act as a one-way valve in substrate transport. The MacB structure features an atypical transmembrane domain (TMD) with a closely packed dimer interface and a periplasmic opening that is the likely portal for substrate entry from the periplasm, with subsequent displacement through an allosteric transport mechanism.},

  abstract = {More than half of all women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime with most cases caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Bacterial motility enhances UPEC pathogenicity, resulting in more severe disease outcomes including kidney infection. Surprisingly, the connection between motility and iron limitation is mostly unexplored, despite the lack of free iron available in the host. Therefore, we sought to explore the potential connection between iron restriction and regulation of motility in UPEC. We cultured E. coli CFT073, a prototypical UPEC strain, in media containing an iron chelator. Under iron limitation, CFT073 had elevated fliC (flagella) promoter activity, driving motility on the leading edge of the colony. Furthermore, this iron-specific response was repressed by the addition of exogenous iron. We confirmed increased flagella expression in CFT073 by measuring fliC transcript, FliC protein, and surface-expressed flagella under iron-limited conditions. To define the regulatory mechanism, we constructed single knockouts of eight master regulators. The iron-regulated response was lost in crp, arcA, and fis mutants. Thus, we focused on the five genes regulated by all three transcription factors. Of the five genes knocked out, the iron-regulated motility response was most strongly dysregulated in an lpdA mutant, which also resulted in significantly lowered fitness in the murine model of ascending UTI. Collectively, we demonstrated that iron-mediated motility in CFT073 is regulated by lpdA, which contributes to the understanding of how uropathogens differentially regulate motility mechanisms in the iron-restricted host. Importance Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are ubiquitous and responsible for over five billion dollars in associated health care costs annually. Both iron acquisition and motility are highly studied virulence factors associated with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), the main causative agent of uncomplicated UTI. This work is innovative by providing mechanistic insight into the synergistic relationship between these two critical virulence properties. Here, we demonstrate that iron limitation has pleiotropic effects with consequences that extend beyond metabolism, and impact other virulence mechanisms. Indeed, targeting iron acquisition as a therapy may lead to an undesirable enhancement of UPEC pathogenesis through increased motility. It is vital to understand the full breadth of UPEC pathogenesis to adequately respond to this common infection, especially with the increase of antibiotic resistant pathogens.},

Here, we test for systematic change in tidepool fish communities between recent and historical data sets, which include the North Pacific marine heatwave of 2014--2016. Location Periodic sampling occurred since 1966 at study site isolated from human activities on the Pacific west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. Methods Repeated fish sampling at seven wave-exposed rocky shore tidepools was conducted on 8 (historical: 1966--1993) and 5 (recent: 2012--2016) occasions during low tide using methods that capture all individuals present (including cryptic and rare species). Species were subsequently identified using standard taxonomic approaches and abundances recorded. These data comprised the basis for analyses of both community-level and species-specific responses to test for differences in the historical and recent time periods. Results We did not detect systematic increases or declines in species density, total abundance of fishes within tidepools and community similarity between historical and recent sampling events in high-intertidal pools. However, fish communities from low-shore pools decreased in the number of species present, overall abundance and community similarity. Those species lost from the lower pools were non-resident rare species typical of subtidal environments. By contrast, a warm-affinity crevice kelpfish was observed only recently. We also found that six species had higher or lower abundances between historical and recent sampling events, and one species occurred at higher vertical heights. Main conclusion Fish communities in high-intertidal pools were resilient between historical and recent sampling periods, and lacked evidence of invasion. However, some signals of community and species changes were evident in the lower shore. Overall, these communities may reach a threshold with ongoing ocean warming and continued monitoring is required to reveal any major changes as they unfold.},

The EPS biochemistry promotes recalcitrance and informs the design of therapies to reduce or eliminate biofilm burden.},

  abstract = {In humans, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the most common etiological agent of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Cranberry extracts have been linked to the prevention of UTIs for over a century; however, a mechanistic understanding of the way in which cranberry derivatives prevent bacterial infection is still lacking. In this study, we used a fliC-lux reporter as well as quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to demonstrate that when UPEC strain CFT073 was grown or exposed to dehydrated, crushed cranberries or to purified cranberry-derived proanthocyanidins (cPACs), expression of the flagellin gene (fliC) was inhibited. In agreement with these results, transmission electron microscopy imaging of bacteria grown in the presence of cranberry materials revealed fewer flagella than those in bacteria grown under control conditions. Furthermore, we showed that swimming and swarming motilities were hindered when bacteria were grown in the presence of the cranberry compounds. Because flagellum-mediated motility has been suggested to enable UPEC to disseminate to the upper urinary tract, we propose that inhibition of flagellum-mediated motility might be a key mechanism by which cPACs prevent UTIs. This is the first report to show that cranberry compounds inhibit UPEC motility via downregulation of the fliC gene. Further studies are required to establish whether these inhibitors play a role in vivo.},

Pairwise comparisons of the cryoprotective activity of the more common CPAs used in cryomicrobiology, based on published experimental reports, indicate that the most successful CPAs have been Me2SO, methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and serum or serum albumin, while glycerol, polyethylene glycol, PVP, and sucrose are less successful, and other sugars, dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, sorbitol, and milk are the least effective. However, diols (as well as some other CPAs) are toxic for many microbes. Me2SO might be regarded as the most universally useful CPA, although certain other CPAs can sometimes yield better recoveries with particular organisms. The best CPA, or combination of CPAs, and the optimum concentration for a particular cryosensitive microorganism has to be determined empirically. This review aims to provide a summary of the main experimental findings with a wide range of additives and organisms. A brief discussion of mechanisms of CPA action is also included.},

  abstract = {Many bacteria use flagella to swim individually through bulk liquid, or swarm collectively over a semi-solid surface. In E. coli, c-di-GMP inhibits swimming via the effector protein YcgR. We show in this study that contrary to its effect on swimming, a certain threshold level of c-di-GMP is required for swarming. Gene expression profiles first indicated that several c-di-GMP synthases -- dgcJ, dgcM, dgcO - were upregulated during swarming. Of these, we found DgcO to play a critical role. DgcO is reported to affect PGA (poly-{$\beta$}-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine) synthesis in E. coli. We show that DgcO also promotes production of colanic acid - one of the three major exopolysaccharides in E. coli, and that colanic acid has hitherto-unknown surfactant properties that are expected to aid swarming. Importance It is well-established that in bacteria, c-di-GMP inhibits flagella-driven motility at various points in the pathway. Concomitantly, elevated c-di-GMP levels induce the expression and synthesis of a variety of exopolysaccharides that enmesh the bacteria in a biofilm, thereby also interfering with flagella function. This study reports the surprising finding that in E. coli, the exopolysaccharide colanic acid is required to enable surface navigation and that the diguanylate cyclase DgcO is employed for this purpose. For surface navigation, there appears to be a sweet spot where c-di-GMP levels are just right to produce polysaccharides that can serve as surfactants and wetting agents rather than promote formation of biofilms.},

  abstract = {Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (C-UTI). It blocks indwelling urethral catheters through the formation of extensive crystalline biofilms. The obstruction of urine flow can induce episodes of pyelonephritis, septicemia, and shock. P. mirabilis exhibits a type of motility referred to as swarming, in which multicellular rafts of elongated, hyperflagellated swarmer cells form and move rapidly in concert over solid surfaces. It has been suggested that swarming is important in the pathogenesis of C-UTI. In this study we generated a set of stable transposon mutants deficient in swarming and used them to assess the role of swarming in the migration of P. mirabilis over urinary catheters. Swarming was found to be essential for migration over all-silicone catheters. Swarming-deficient mutants were attenuated in migration over hydrogel-coated latex catheters, but those capable of swimming motility were able to move over and infect these surfaces. A novel vapor fixation technique for the preparation of specimens and scanning electron microscopy were used to resolve the ultrastructure of P. mirabilis multicellular rafts. The flagellar filaments of P. mirabilis were found to be highly organized during raft migration and were interwoven in phase to form helical connections between adjacent swarmer cells. Mutants lacking these novel organized structures failed to swarm successfully. We suggest that these structures are important for migration and formation of multicellular rafts. In addition, the highly organized structure of multicellular rafts enables P. mirabilis to initiate C-UTI by migration over catheter surfaces from the urethral meatus into the bladder.},

  abstract = {In the Escherichia coli genome, five putative open reading frame (ORF) clusters, mdlAB, ybjYZ, yddA, yojHI, and yhiH, have been assumed to be possible genes for ABC drug efflux transporters (I. T. Paulsen, M. K. Sliwinski, and M. H. Saier, Jr., J. Mol. Biol. 277:573--592, 1998). We cloned all of these ORFs in multicopy plasmids and investigated the drug resistance of drug-supersensitive host cells lacking constitutive multidrug efflux transporter genes acrAB. Among them, only ybjYZ gave significant erythromycin resistance and significantly decreased the accumulation of [14C]erythromycin. Therefore, ybjYZ was renamed macAB (macrolide-specific ABC-type efflux carrier). Plasmids carrying both the macA and -B genes conferred resistance against macrolides composed of 14- and 15-membered lactones but no or weak resistance against 16-membered ones. Neither of the two genes produced resistance alone. The DNA sequence suggests that MacB is an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane segments and one nucleotide-binding domain, while MacA belongs to a membrane fusion protein (MFP) family with a signal-like sequence at its N terminus. The expression of the histidine-tagged proteins confirmed that MacB is an integral membrane protein and MacA is a peripheral membrane protein. In addition, MacAB required TolC for its function in a way similar to that of most of the MFP-dependent transporters in E. coli. MacB is thus a novel ABC-type macrolide efflux transporter which functions by cooperating with the MFP MacA and the multifunctional outer membrane channel TolC. This is the first case of an experimentally identified ABC antibiotic efflux transporter in gram-negative organisms.},

  abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) causes most uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in humans. Flagellum-mediated motility and chemotaxis have been suggested to contribute to virulence by enabling UPEC to escape host immune responses and disperse to new sites within the urinary tract. To evaluate their contribution to virulence, six separate flagellar mutations were constructed in UPEC strain CFT073. The mutants constructed were shown to have four different flagellar phenotypes: fliA and fliC mutants do not produce flagella; the flgM mutant has similar levels of extracellular flagellin as the wild type but exhibits less motility than the wild type; the motAB mutant is nonmotile; and the cheW and cheY mutants are motile but nonchemotactic. Virulence was assessed by transurethral independent challenges and cochallenges of CBA mice with the wild type and each mutant. CFU/ml of urine or CFU/g bladder or kidney was determined 3 days postinoculation for the independent challenges and at 6, 16, 48, 60, and 72 h postinoculation for the cochallenges. While these mutants colonized the urinary tract during independent challenge, each of the mutants was outcompeted by the wild-type strain to various degrees at specific time points during cochallenge. Altogether, these results suggest that flagella and flagellum-mediated motility/chemotaxis may not be absolutely required for virulence but that these traits contribute to the fitness of UPEC and therefore significantly enhance the pathogenesis of UTIs caused by UPEC.},

Previous studies of a TonB transmembrane domain mutant (TonB-{$\Delta$}V17) and its phenotypical suppressor (ExbB-A39E) suggested that TonB is conformationally sensitive. Here, two new mutations of the conserved TonB transmembrane domain SHLS motif were isolated, TonB-S16L and -H20Y, as were two new suppressors, ExbB-V35E and -V36D. Each suppressor ExbB restored at least partial function to the TonB mutants, although TonB-{$\Delta$}V17, for which both the conserved motif and the register of the predicted transmembrane domain {$\alpha$}-helix are affected, was the most refractory. As demonstrated previously, TonB can undergo at least one conformational change, provided both ExbB and a functional TonB transmembrane domain are present. Here, we show that this conformational change reflects the ability of TonB to respond to the cytoplasmic membrane proton gradient, and occurs in proportion to the level of TonB activity attained by mutant--suppressor pairs. The phenotype of TonB-{$\Delta$}V17 was more complex than the -S16L and -H20Y mutations, in that, beyond the inability to be energized efficiently, it was also conditionally unstable. This second defect was evident only after suppression by the ExbB mutants, which allow transmembrane domain mutants to be energized, and presented as the rapid turnover of TonB-{$\Delta$}V17. Importantly, this degradation was dependent upon the presence of a TonB-dependent ligand, suggesting that TonB conformation also changes following the energy transduction event. Together, these observations support a dynamic model of energy transduction in which TonB cycles through a set of conformations that differ in potential energy, with a transition to a higher energy state driven by pmf and a transition to a lower energy state accompanying release of stored potential energy to an outer membrane receptor.},

  abstract = {Bacterial motility is thought to play an important role in virulence. We have previously shown that proficient bacterial swimming and swarming in vitro is correlated with the persistent intramammary infection phenotype observed in cattle. However, little is known about the gene regulation differences important for different motility phenotypes in Escherichia coli. In this work, three E. coli strains that cause persistent bovine mastitis infections were grown in three media that promote different types of motility (planktonic, swimming, and swarming). Using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, we identified a total of 935 genes ({\textasciitilde}21\% of the total genome) that were differentially expressed in comparisons of the various motility-promoting conditions. We found that approximately 7\% of the differentially expressed genes were associated with iron regulation. We show that motility assays using iron or iron chelators confirmed the importance of iron regulation to the observed motility phenotypes. Because of the observation that E. coli strains that cause persistent infections are more motile, we contend that better understanding of the genes that are differentially expressed due to the type of motility will yield important information about how bacteria can become established within a host. Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate bacterial motility may provide new approaches in the development of intervention strategies as well as facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.IMPORTANCE Bacteria can exhibit various types of motility.

In this study, we found that purified MacA, a periplasmic membrane fusion protein, contains one tightly bound rough core lipopolysaccharide (R-LPS) molecule per MacA molecule. R-LPS was bound specifically to MacA protein with affinity exceeding that of polymyxin B. Sequence analyses showed that MacA contains two high-density clusters of positively charged amino acid residues located in the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and the periplasmic C-terminal domain. Substitutions in the C-terminal cluster reducing the positive-charge density completely abolished binding of R-LPS. At the same time, these substitutions significantly reduced the functionality of MacA in the protection of E. coli against macrolides in vivo and in the in vitro MacB ATPase stimulation assays. Taken together, our results suggest that R-LPS or a similar glycolipid is a physiological substrate of MacAB-TolC.},

  abstract = {The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is essential for their survival in harsh environments and provides intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This membrane is remarkable; it is a highly asymmetric lipid bilayer. The inner leaflet of the outer membrane contains phospholipids whereas the fatty acyl chains attached to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) comprise the hydrophobic portion of the outer leaflet. This lipid asymmetry, and in particular the exclusion of phospholipids from the outer leaflet, is key to creating an almost impenetrable barrier to hydrophobic molecules that can otherwise pass through phospholipid bilayers. It has long been known that these lipids are not made in the outer membrane. It is now believed that conserved multi-subunit protein machines extract these lipids after their synthesis is completed at the inner membrane and transport them to the outer membrane. A longstanding question is how the cell builds and maintains this asymmetric lipid bilayer in coordination with the assembly of the other components of the cell envelope. This review describes the trans-envelope lipid transport systems that have been identified to participate in outer membrane biogenesis: LPS transport via the Lpt machine, and phospholipid transport via the Mla pathway and several recently proposed transporters.,},

  abstract = {Efflux and motility are two key biological functions in bacteria. Recent findings have shown that efflux impacts flagellum biosynthesis and motility in Escher ichia coli and other bacteria. AcrR is known to be the major transcriptional repressor of AcrAB-TolC, the main multidrug efflux pump in E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how efflux and motility are co-regula ted remain poorly understood. Here, we have studied the role of AcrR in direct regulation of motility in E. coli. By combining bioinformatics, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), gene expression, and motility experiments, we have found that AcrR represses motility in E. coli by directly repressing transcription of the flhDC operon, but not the other flagellum genes/operons tested. flhDC encodes the master regulator of flagellum biosynthesis and motility genes. We found that such regulation primarily occurs by direct binding of AcrR to the flhDC promoter region containing the first of the two predicted AcrR-binding sites identified in this promoter. This is the first report of direct regulation by AcrR of genes unrelated to efflux or detoxification. Moreover, we report that overexpression of AcrR restores to parental levels the increased swimming motility previously observed in E. coli strains without a functional AcrAB-TolC pump, and that such effect by AcrR is prevented by the AcrR ligand and AcrAB-TolC substrate ethidium bromide. Based on these and prior findings, we provide a novel model in which AcrR senses efflux and then co-regulates efflux and motility in E. coli to maintain homeostasis and escape hazards.},

  abstract = {Organisms generally respond to iron deficiency by increasing their capacity to take up iron and by consuming intracellular iron stores. Escherichia coli, in which iron metabolism is particularly well understood, contains at least 7 iron-acquisition systems encoded by 35 iron-repressed genes. This Fe-dependent repression is mediated by a transcriptional repressor, Fur (ferric uptake regulation), which also controls genes involved in other processes such as iron storage, the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, pathogenicity, and redox-stress resistance. Our macroarray-based global analysis of iron- and Fur-dependent gene expression in E. coli has revealed several novel Fur-repressed genes likely to specify at least three additional iron-transport pathways. Interestingly, a large group of energy metabolism genes was found to be iron and Fur induced. Many of these genes encode iron-rich respiratory complexes. This iron- and Fur-dependent regulation appears to represent a novel iron-homeostatic mechanism whereby the synthesis of many iron-containing proteins is repressed under iron-restricted conditions. This mechanism thus accounts for the low iron contents of fur mutants and explains how E. coli can modulate its iron requirements. Analysis of 55Fe-labeled E. coli proteins revealed a marked decrease in iron-protein composition for the fur mutant, and visible and EPR spectroscopy showed major reductions in cytochrome b and d levels, and in iron-sulfur cluster contents for the chelator-treated wild-type and/or fur mutant, correlating well with the array and quantitative RT-PCR data. In combination, the results provide compelling evidence for the regulation of intracellular iron consumption by the Fe2+-Fur complex.},

This is a narrative review aimed at acting as an introduction to the epidemiology and burden of UTIs. This review is based on relevant literature according to the experience and expertise of the authors. The prevalence of UTI increases with age, and in women aged over 65 is approximately double the rate seen in the female population overall. Etiology in this age group varies by health status with factors such as catheterization affecting the likelihood of infection and the pathogens most likely to be responsible. In younger women, increased sexual activity is a major risk factor for UTIs and recurrence within 6\,months is common. In the female population overall, more serious infections such as pyelonephritis are less frequent but are associated with a significant burden of care due to the risk of hospitalization. Healthcare-associated UTIs (HAUTIs) are the most common form of healthcare-acquired infection. Large global surveys indicate that the nature of pathogens varies between the community and hospital setting. In addition, the pathogens responsible for HAUTIs vary according to region making adequate local data key to infection control. UTIs create a significant societal and personal burden, with a substantial number of medical visits in the United States every year being related to UTIs. European data indicate that recurrent infections are related to increased absenteeism and physician visits. In addition, quality of life measures are significantly impacted in women suffering from recurrent UTIs. Data suggest that nonantimicrobial prophylactic strategies offer an opportunity to reduce both the rate of UTIs and the personal burden experience by patients.},

  abstract = {RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Division) family transporters are widespread especially among Gram-negative bacteria, and catalyze the active efflux of many antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents. They have very large periplasmic domains, and form tripartite complexes with outer membrane channels and periplasmic adaptor proteins. AcrAB-TolC complex of Escherichia coli, which pumps out a very wide range of drugs, has been studied most intensively. Early studies showed that the transporter captures even those substrates that cannot permeate across the cytoplasmic membrane, such as dianionic {$\beta$}-lactams, suggesting that the capture can occur from the periplasm. It was also suggested that the capture occurs from the cytoplasmic membrane/periplasm interface, because most substrates contain a sizable hydrophobic domain; however, this may simply be a reflection of the nature of the binding site within AcrB. Genetic studies of chimeric transporters showed that much of the substrate specificity is determined by their periplasmic domains. Biochemical studies with intact cells recently led to the determination of the kinetic constants of AcrB for some {$\beta$}-lactams, and the result confirms the old prediction that AcrB is a rather slow pump. Reconstitution of purified AcrB and its relatives showed that the pump is a drug/proton antiporter, that AcrA strongly stimulates the activity of the pump, and that AcrB seems to have a highest affinity for conjugated bile salts. Structural study with mutants of the network of charged residues in the transmembrane domain showed that protonation here produced a far-reaching conformational change, which was found to be present in one of the protomers in the asymmetric crystal structure of the wild-type AcrB. The functional rotatory hypothesis then predicts that the drug bound in the periplasmic domain is extruded through this conformational change initiated by the protonation of one of the residues in the aforementioned network, an idea that was recently supported by disulfide cross-linking as well as by the behavior of linked AcrB protomers.},

The siderophore substrates range in complexity from simple small molecules such as citrate to large proteins like serum transferrin and haemoglobin. Because iron uptake is vital for almost all bacteria, expression of TBDTs is regulated in a number of ways that include metal-dependent regulators, {$\sigma$}/anti-{$\sigma$} factor systems, small RNAs, and even a riboswitch. In recent years many new structures of TBDTs have been solved in various states, resulting in a more complete picture of siderophore selectivity and binding, signal transduction across the outer membrane, and interaction with TonB-ExbB-ExbD. However, the transport mechanism is still unclear. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding regulation, structure and function in TBDTs and questions remaining to be answered.},

Here, we tested the effect of overexpressing functionally defective pump components in wild type E. coli cells to probe the pump assembly process. Incorporation of a defective component is expected to reduce the efflux efficiency of the complex, leading to the so called ``dominant negative'' effect. Being one of the most intensively studied bacterial multidrug efflux pumps, many AcrA and AcrB mutations have been reported that disrupt efflux through different mechanisms. We examined five groups of AcrB and AcrA mutants, defective in different aspects of assembly and substrate efflux. We found that none of them demonstrated the expected dominant negative effect, even when expressed at concentrations many folds higher than their genomic counterpart. The assembly of the AcrAB-TolC complex appears to have a proof-read mechanism that effectively eliminated the formation of futile pump complex.},

  abstract = {Background Ethiopia has received 2.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility and planned to vaccinate 20\% of its population by the end of 2021. However, evidence on the current uptake of the vaccine in our country is scanty. Therefore, this study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine uptake and associated factors among health professionals in Ethiopia. Methods A national online cross-sectional E-survey was conducted on COVID-19 vaccine Uptake and associated factors among health professionals in Ethiopia from June 1 to 30, 2021. A semi-structured questionnaire was created on Google forms and disseminated online. The snowball sampling technique through the authors' network with Ethiopian residents on the popular social media like Facebook, telegram, and email was used. Descriptive statistics were performed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25, and all variables with P-value {$<$}0.05 and adjusted odds ratio at 95\% CI were used to declare the predictors of the outcome variable. Results A total of 522 health professionals participated in the survey, of which about 324 (62.1\%) of them were vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines at least once. The study indicated that COVID-19 vaccine uptake was associated with age range from 35 to 44 years [AOR = 12.97, 95\% CI: 2.36--71.21], age beyond 45 years [AOR = 18.95, 95\% CI = 2.04--36.29], being male [AOR = 2.91, 95\% CI = 1.05,8.09], being only an academician [AOR = 0.23, 95\% CI: 0.10--0.49], academicians working in University hospitals [AOR = 0.19, 95\% CI: 0.05--0.83], perceiving their family as healthy [AOR = 4.40, 95\% CI: 2.21--8.75], no history of receiving other vaccine before as an adult [AOR = 4.07, 95\% CI: 2.07--8.01] and no history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or clients [AOR = 0.42, 95\% CI: 0.20--0.86]. Conclusion The study found that COVID-19 vaccine uptake among health professionals was low. This was not sufficient to achieve herd immunity as at least nine out of ten health professionals are required for herd immunity. Ages, sex, place of work, perceived family health status, previous experience of receiving a vaccine as an adult and history of contact with COVID-19 clients or patients were the factors that influence the vaccine uptake among health professionals in Ethiopia. Hence, decision makers and health managers should consider instituting mandatory vaccination for health professionals and design strategies for the provision of the vaccine.},

For siderophore systems in particular, recent studies have identified new roles for siderophore copper binding as well as production of siderophore-like inhibitors of iron uptake by other, competing bacterial species. Among these is a process of nutritional passivation of metal ions, in which uropathogens access these vital nutrients while simultaneously protecting themselves from their toxic potential.

  abstract = {Escherichia coli biofilm consists of a bacterial colony embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which protects the microbes from adverse environmental conditions and results in infection. Besides being the major causative agent for recurrent urinary tract infections, E.~coli biofilm is also responsible for indwelling medical device-related infectivity. The cell-to-cell communication within the biofilm occurs due to quorum sensors that can modulate the key biochemical players enabling the bacteria to proliferate and intensify the resultant infections. The diversity in structural components of biofilm gets compounded due to the development of antibiotic resistance, hampering its eradication. Conventionally used antimicrobial agents have a restricted range of cellular targets and limited efficacy on biofilms. This emphasizes the need to explore the alternate therapeuticals like anti-adhesion compounds, phytochemicals, nanomaterials for effective drug delivery to restrict the growth of biofilm. The current review focuses on various aspects of E.~coli biofilm development and the possible therapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.},

  abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) causes the majority of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI), which affect nearly half of women worldwide. Many UPEC strains carry an annotated intimin-like adhesin (ila) locus in their genome related to a well-characterized virulence factor in diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes. Its role in UPEC uropathogenesis, however, remains unknown. In prototype UPEC strain CFT073, there is an ila locus that contains three predicted intimin-like genes, sinH, sinI, and ratA. We used in silico approaches to determine the phylogeny and genomic distribution of this locus among uropathogens. We found that the currently annotated intimin locus-encoded proteins in CFT073 are more closely related to invasin proteins found in Salmonella. Deletion of the individual sinH, sinI, and ratA genes did not result in measurable effects on growth, biofilm formation, or motility in vitro. On average, sinH was more highly expressed in clinical strains during active human UTI than in human urine ex vivo. Unexpectedly, we found that strains lacking this ila locus had increased adherence to bladder cells in vitro, coupled with a decrease in bladder cell invasion and death. The sinH mutant displayed a significant fitness defect in the murine model of ascending UTI, including reduced inflammation in the bladder. These data confirmed an inhibitory role in bladder cell adherence to facilitate invasion and inflammation; therefore, the ila locus should be termed invasin-like rather than intimin-like. Collectively, our data suggest that loss of this locus mediates measurable interactions with bladder cells in vitro and contributes to fitness during UTI.},

SCN can interfere with \emph{E. coli} iron acquisition by sequestering ferric iron complexes with enterobactin, the conserved \emph{E. coli} siderophore. Here, we find that human urinary constituents can reverse this relationship, instead making enterobactin critical for overcoming SCN-mediated growth restriction. Urinary control of SCN activity exhibits wide ranging individual differences. We used these differences to identify elevated urinary pH and aryl metabolites as key biochemical host factors controlling urinary SCN activity. These aryl metabolites are well known products of intestinal microbial metabolism. Together, these results identify an innate antibacterial immune interaction that is critically dependent upon individualistic chemical features of human urine.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A               tonB               mutant derivative of CFT073 failed to use heme as an iron source or to utilize the siderophores enterobactin and aerobactin, indicating that transport of these compounds in CFT073 is TonB dependent. The TonB               -               derivative showed reduced virulence in a mouse model of urinary tract infection. Virulence was restored when the               tonB               gene was introduced on a plasmid. To determine the importance of the individual TonB-dependent iron transport systems during urinary tract infections, mutants defective in each of the CFT073 high-affinity iron transport systems were constructed and tested in the mouse model. Mouse virulence assays indicated that mutants defective in a single iron transport system were able to infect the kidney when inoculated as a pure culture but were unable to efficiently compete with the wild-type strain in mixed infections. These results indicate a role for TonB-dependent systems in the virulence of uropathogenic               E. coli               strains.},

  abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) biofilm formation enables the organism to avoid the host immune system, resist antibiotics, and provide a reservoir for persistent infection. Once the biofilm is established, eradication of the infection becomes difficult. Therefore, strategies against UPEC biofilm are urgently required. In this study, we investigated the effect of allicin, isolated from garlic essential oil, on UPEC CFT073 and J96 biofilm formation and dispersal, along with its effect on UPEC adhesion ability and swimming motility. Sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of allicin decreased UPEC biofilm formation and affected its architecture. Allicin was also capable of dispersing biofilm. Furthermore, allicin decreased the bacterial adhesion ability and swimming motility, which are important for biofilm formation. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that allicin decreased the expression of UPEC type 1 fimbriae adhesin gene fimH. Docking studies suggested that allicin was located within the binding pocket of heptyl {$\alpha$}-d-mannopyrannoside in FimH and formed hydrogen bonds with Phe1 and Asn135. In addition, allicin decreased the expression of the two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) cognate response regulator gene uvrY and increased the expression of the RNA binding global regulatory protein gene csrA of UPEC CFT073, which is associated with UPEC biofilm. The findings suggest that sub-MICs of allicin are capable of affecting UPEC biofilm formation and dispersal, and decreasing UPEC adhesion ability and swimming motility.},

  abstract = {Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) serves as a bacterial second messenger that modulates various processes including biofilm formation, motility, and host-microbe symbiosis. Numerous studies have conducted comprehensive analysis of c-di-GMP. However, the mechanisms by which certain environmental signals such as iron control intracellular c-di-GMP levels are unclear. Here, we show that iron regulates c-di-GMP levels in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by modulating the interaction between an iron-sensing protein, IsmP, and a diguanylate cyclase, ImcA. Binding of iron to the CHASE4 domain of IsmP inhibits the IsmP-ImcA interaction, which leads to increased c-di-GMP synthesis by ImcA, thus promoting biofilm formation and reducing bacterial motility. Structural characterization of the apo-CHASE4 domain and its binding to iron allows us to pinpoint residues defining its specificity. In addition, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of ImcA in complex with a c-di-GMP analog (GMPCPP) suggests a unique conformation in which the compound binds to the catalytic pockets and to the membrane-proximal side located at the cytoplasm. Thus, our results indicate that a CHASE4 domain directly senses iron and modulates the crosstalk between c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes.},
