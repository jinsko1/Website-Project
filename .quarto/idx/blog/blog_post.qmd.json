This keeps the repo clean: I can isolate the build artifacts in that branch and deploy from there, relieving the main branch of unnecessary clutter. `_site` is also included in `.gitignore` to reduce clutter on the main branch, ensuring that only actual edits are visible in the version history.\n\nThat concludes the mechanics behind the website. I’m sure I’ve mentioned this on the home page, but this website is primarily a way for me to put what I learn into words, which I hope will aid the learning process. I’ll continue doing this with other subjects of interest.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI used Quarto, which was recommended to me by a friend for its simplicity and ease of management.
