    "title": "LB, ∆fur, and Stationary Phase",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dr. Yep noticed how ∆fur stalled earlier than the other strains. It’s not necessarily a problem, but I’d like to understand the cause. The paper should also explain this, so we’ll need the rationale anyway.\n∆fur entered stationary phase early in Lysogeny Broth (LB). This didn’t happen with any of the other strains or media. Why? I’ll attempt to explain this in a few ways.\n\nROS Damage\nSince this phenomenon was absent in all other media, I think the early stalling most likely reflects a specific interaction between the high intracellular iron characteristic of ∆fur, and some inherent property of LB.\nThere appears to be commercial variance in background ROS in LB. LB (Sigma) tends to have more H2O2 than LB (Difco), which is generally gentler (I’m fairly confident we use Sigma). Together with constitutively elevated intracellular iron (Fenton reaction), ∆fur may also be exposed to higher levels of peroxide, causing ROS damage. Components such as riboflavin, reducing sugars, and transition metal ions—present in LB—can generate ROS depending on storage conditions, especially with light exposure (Ezraty et al. 2014).\nNote that ∆fur is easily pushed into oxidative stress as well. Deletion of fur indirectly represses sodB, which encodes iron superoxide dismutase. This enzyme acts as an antioxidant, preventing ROS damage. But in ∆fur, this antioxidant is repressed. Cells must then rely on the product of sodA (manganese superoxide dismutase), and, unfortunately, if Mn is lacking in the environment, there isn’t much the cell can do to prevent ROS damage (Chareyre and Mandin 2018).\nSide note: although it wasn’t exactly stationary phase, there was some growth inhibition with ∆fur in swarming medium as well. Both LB and swarming medium contain yeast extract, which may include components necessary for ROS generation. Of course, this perceived symmetry may be coincidental, and some other intrinsic characteristic attributable to the mutation may be at play; I’m only speculating.\n\n\npH Threshold\nThe effect seen in ∆fur is most likely due to various reasons in combination, including pH damage. One other thing I suspect is the pH threshold of E. coli since LB isn’t really buffered, so left alone, growth can take the media up to a pH of 9 without glucose (swarming media has glucose, which may be why CFT doesn’t top out in swarming media.) Excretion of excess ammonia is to blame for the alkalinization (Sezonov, Joseleau-Petit, and D’Ari 2007).\n\n\nCarbon Exhaustion\nThis one is pretty simple. Since LB is pretty limited terms of its nutrient content, lack of carbon sources in combination with the preceding reasons may account for the early stalling observed for ∆fur in LB (Sezonov, Joseleau-Petit, and D’Ari 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChareyre, Sylvia, and Pierre Mandin. 2018. “Bacterial Iron Homeostasis Regulation by sRNAs.” Microbiology Spectrum 6 (2): 10.1128/microbiolspec.rwr-0010-2017. https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.rwr-0010-2017.\n\n\nEzraty, Benjamin, Camille Henry, Marion Hérisse, Erick Denamur, and Frédéric Barras. 2014. “Commercial Lysogeny Broth Culture Media and Oxidative Stress: A Cautious Tale.” Free Radical Biology and Medicine 74 (September): 245–51. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.07.010.\n\n\nSezonov, Guennadi, Danièle Joseleau-Petit, and Richard D’Ari. 2007. “Escherichia Coli Physiology in Luria-Bertani Broth.” Journal of Bacteriology 189 (23): 8746–49. https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.01368-07."

    "text": "In the lab, Kelsey and I have been running into issues with the biofilm assay. Regardless of the incubation period, the E. coli strains that are supposed to form biofilms aren’t doing so. After a couple of failed attempts, we also tried growing Pseudomonas, which is known for robust biofilm formation, but this trial also resulted in no observable biofilm. By testing these two strains, we could assess whether the problem lies with the E. coli strains we were using or whether it stems from a systemic error in our protocol.\nGiven the fact that Pseudomonas also failed to form observable biofilms, we concluded that the error most likely originates in the protocol. Since I’ve never done this before, in the subsequent passages I attempt to explicate and justify the steps in the biofilm procedure and where we might have erred."

    "title": "Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer’s Disease",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The paper is a bit old, but it’s interesting I learn from reading and writing about it so here it is: the lecanemab paper reads, at first glance, like the trial we’ve been waiting for (Dyck et al. 2023).\nThis is a big phase 3 trial in NEJM where an anti-amyloid antibody finally does what the field has been promising for quite some time. It strips amyloid out of the brain and the treatment group declines more slowly than placebo over eighteen months. It’s statistically clean, biomarkers all pointing in the right direction, figures that slope apart in the way grant proposals like to appeal.\nTechnically you are removing material; structurally it might be too late.\nThe core biology is pretty familiar. Amyloid-β is shaved off the amyloid precursor protein, misfolds, and aggregates into extracellular plaques. Tau, inside the neuron, becomes hyperphosphorylated and tangles up the microtubules that were supposed to carry cargo; synapses thin out; networks lose coherence (Kumar et al. 2021). In parallel, the vasculature of an aging brain quietly turns hostile: small-vessel disease, and crucially, CAA not in the parenchyma this time, but packed into the walls of tiny arteries and arterioles.\nLecanemab is a monoclonal antibody against soluble amyloid protofibrils, given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. In this trial, about 1,800 people with “early” Alzheimer’s—mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, all amyloid-positive on PET or CSF—were randomized to drug or placebo and followed for eighteen months. The primary outcome was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), a clinician-rated 0–18 scale that tries to compress memory, orientation, judgment, community affairs, hobbies, and personal care into a single trajectory.\nOn that metric, the placebo group worsened by about 1.66 points. The lecanemab group worsened by about 1.21. The difference—roughly 0.45 CDR-SB points (95% confidence interval, −0.67 to −0.23; P&lt;0.001)—is what becomes the “27% slowing of decline”. Amyloid PET scans show the drug is doing what it says: plaque signal falls dramatically compared with placebo. Fluid biomarkers like phosphorylated tau drift in the right direction. At the level of graphs and p-values, the paper is satisfyingly coherent.\nBut you have to translate these results back into an actual elderly human being.\nReal patients are not the stylized creatures of trial diagrams. They come with AFib and a history of deep vein thrombosis and coronary stents and that one “small stroke” no one talks about at family dinners. They are already on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant to keep clots from forming in AFib; or on aspirin and clopidogrel to keep a metal stent in the left anterior descending from occluding; or both. These drugs flatten the normal peaks of coagulation so that clots are slower to form, bleeds are harder to stop, and any damage, even slight, to a vessel wall has more room to become a crisis.\nThe new class of anti-amyloid antibodies all carry the side effect, ARIA. ARIA-E is vasogenic edema or effusion, pockets of swelling or fluid that show in white on the MRI. ARIA-H is microhemorrhages that leave scars. In this trial, roughly a quarter of patients had infusion reactions, and around twelve to thirteen percent developed ARIA-E; ARIA-H also increased in the active arm. Most of these findings were asymptomatic and discovered on scheduled scans, but not all. Some patients had headache, confusion, or seizures; post-marketing reports have documented rare but real fatal hemorrhages. The FDA label now comes with a boxed warning spelling out the risks, especially in people on anticoagulants.\nNone of this is surprising. Anti-amyloid antibodies strip amyloid off vessel walls as well as off plaques. If those vessels are already stiff, hypertensive, and studded with amyloid from decades of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, “cleaning” them can mean destabilizing them. The wall leaks a little: ARIA-E. The wall cracks a little: ARIA-H. Add systemic anticoagulation or aggressive antiplatelet therapy to that fragility and the margin between “tiny microbleed that never matters” and “lobar hemorrhage that changes the course of your life” gets uncomfortably thin.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n\n    A[Elderly patient&lt;br/&gt;Vascular fragility] --&gt; B[Anticoagulants&lt;br/&gt;/ Antiplatelets]\n    A --&gt; C[Lecanemab]\n\n    C --&gt; D[Amyloid removal]\n    D --&gt; H[Modest slowing&lt;br/&gt;of decline]\n\n    D --&gt; E[ARIA-E / ARIA-H]\n    B --&gt; E\n    E --&gt; F[Edema / Microbleeds / ICH]\n    F --&gt; G[Hospitalization&lt;br/&gt;Functional decline]\n\n    H -. small benefit vs risk .- G\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial tries to manage this with MRIs: baseline imaging to exclude anyone with too many microbleeds and follow-up scans at defined time points. This schedule alone is a selection pressure: to even begin, you need a body that tolerates lying still in a noisy tube at these points in time. Once you move from the idealized trial environment to a real clinic that already can’t get outpatients into MRI within a month, the whole premise is undermined.\nMeanwhile the patient is supposed to show up every two weeks, indefinitely, for an intravenous infusion. For someone in their forties, this is boring. For someone in their eighties who walks with a frame and gets disoriented on unfamiliar floors, every visit is an opportunity for a fall, a urinary infection, a bout of hospital delirium that sets them back more than any fraction of a CDR-SB point can capture (remember that this is not a perfect metric).\nThere is also the quieter question of what “0.45 points” buys you, existentially.\nThe paper, reads like a proof of concept for a pathophysiological story, not a compelling offer for the average person who actually has this disease. It tells us that amyloid matters, that if you remove a lot of it early enough you can nudge the clinical trajectory in the right direction. It also tells us, indirectly, that by the time the diagnosis is even on the table, the brain is already woven through with other forms of damage that an antibody cannot touch.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDyck, Christopher H. van, Chad J.

    "text": "I’ve had this thought for a while but have never bothered writing it down. I was reminded of it while I was writing about sequencing. I found myself making wishy-washy explanations, characteristic of a biologist, when it came to the mechanisms at the molecular level.\nI can only explain these pieces of technology from the perspective of an amateur biologist, and would, instead, if possible, explain these technologies from the perspective of a chemist or physicist. But I am merely a biologist. It is my firm belief that after a certain point, biology is merely an abstraction of chemistry and physics, and a thorough understanding of these disciplines (which I do not possess) is required for a complete understanding. That is, my knowledge of these technologies will start breaking down after questions pertaining to the chemistry and physics of these technologies are brought forth. I would argue that one must be a decent physicist and chemist before even attempting to call themselves a good biologist.\nThe beauty of biology is only appreciated once you understand mechanism in totality.\nIf a biologist desires to go beyond conventional applications of a tool available to them, an understanding of how things work is crucial, and not just how to use them. But the understanding of how things work only arrives along with the knowledge of these superior disciplines that have generated the field we now call biology.\nSince the amount of knowledge required to complete these novel experiments is far beyond the scope of a single biologist, one would expect to find biologists eager to collaborate with chemists and physicists alike. This is not uncommon, but far less common than I expect it to be, which I find very odd.\nI apologize for the abrupt ending but I’ll stop there since further discussion will turn into a lengthy rant."

    "text": "1st Gen Sequencing\nDideoxy gene sequencing uses what is called “primed synthesis” for sequencing. Primed synthesis works as follows: primers anneal onto a denatured strand of DNA, yielding ssDNA and creating a free 3’-OH group. A DNA polymerase then binds to the oligonucleotide primer, copying the remainder of the template strand. Understanding this mechanism is important for understanding the later stages of sequencing.\nTo sequence a specific section of the genome, the DNA sequence in question is cloned via PCR. This ensures the proper strength of the signal on the autoradiograph later on. The DNA duplex is then denatured, and primers are annealed. The Klenow fragment then synthesizes the copy of the template strand. The Klenow fragment is used instead of DNA polymerase I because the fragment lacks the 5’→3’ endonuclease function. This ensures the primer is not digested when the polymerase is introduced to the sample.\nWithin the test tubes, along with the dNTPs used to elongate the daughter strand, one type of ddNTP is included in low concentrations, hence the name “dideoxy” sequencing. The ddNTPs are missing the 3’-OH group, disallowing elongation of the strand as phosphodiester bonds aren’t allowed to form. The concentrations of ddNTPs are kept low to ensure that termination of the daughter strand does not happen too often. This is done four times in four different test tubes to create fragments that terminate at corresponding nucleotides.\nAs a result, nested fragments are formed. These are fragments of DNA that differ in length due to the random incorporation of ddNTPs. You can run these fragments along a four-channel agarose gel (each channel corresponds to a test tube with a specific ddNTP), usually with urea and high temperature to ensure denaturing conditions. You don’t want secondary structures to interfere with the distance traveled by the fragments.\nYou can then take the gel and expose it onto a film to create the autoradiograph. Reading this is pretty simple: just read the film from the bottom up. Keep your eyes peeled for minuscule differences between the base pairs across the four channels. First-generation sequencing is pretty accurate and is still used today; it is the gold standard of sequencing due to its accuracy."

    "section": "NGS",
    "text": "NGS\nNGS stands for next-generation sequencing.\nAfter dideoxy sequencing was developed, large-scale sequencing consisted of large machines in increasingly larger buildings. This was obviously not very cost-effective, and scientists needed a different approach to sequencing.\nWhile second-generation sequencing requires the amplification of identical fragments via PCR, third-gen sequencing does not, eliminating any errors that may arise at this stage. For both generations, you can use two types of gene libraries: Fragment libraries, which are produced via sonication of the genome, or amplicon libraries, which are produced via PCR of a certain subsection of the genome. Naturally, since you are targeting the entire genome, there is less coverage (less likelihood of sequencing a certain base pair) with fragment libraries. Fragment libraries are more probability-based than amplicon libraries since fragment libraries cover a larger area. To fix this, you could increase the depth of the read, but that’s more work. Under normal circumstances, one achieves what they need from an amplicon library that tells them something about a specific gene of interest or a subsection of the genome. The ends of the fragments are usually edited so that detection of the fragments becomes possible.\nThird-gen sequencing is more interesting to me, so I’ll talk about that and skip second-gen, though I feel a bit bad (not really). This type of sequencing has absolutely no semblance to 1st-gen (Dideoxy sequencing).\n\nSMRT Sequencing\nSMRT stands for Single-Molecule Real-Time sequencing.\nThe contraption used for sequencing consists of a DNA polymerase attached to the bottom of zero-mode waveguides (very small wells), approximately 100 nm in diameter. A strand of ssDNA is then passed into the well, along with dNTP-fl (fluorophore-labeled dNTPs). From the bottom of the well, an excitatory wavelength is shot out, so when the ssDNA incorporates the dNTP-fl as its daughter strand, a wavelength of light is emitted specific to the nucleotide, allowing for sequencing. It helps to have the zero-mode waveguide so small to dampen any background noise.\nNote that if you are passing a linear sequence of DNA through the ZMW, the accuracy tends to be pretty low. Instead, adaptors are added to the ends of the DNA to make the fragment of DNA circular. This allows for repetition of reads, increasing the depth of sequencing. You could technically just throw a linear sequence in, but accuracy goes down real fast; something like 99.9% to 87%.\n\n\nNanopore Sequencing\nThis is the most modern type of third-gen sequencing. The smallest version of this device can be held in your palm and be plugged into a computer. This particular piece of technology consists of a membrane with embedded nanopores, usually constructed of proteins. A voltage is applied across this polymer membrane, and a current is created in the nanopore. When an ssDNA strand passes through this nanopore, small disturbances in the current are detected. These disturbances can be discerned from each other due to the different sizes of the nitrogenous bases. A sequence can then be generated with the disturbances plotted on a graph.\nAn adaptor sequence is added onto the strand to improve entry into the nanopore. There’s usually a motor protein of some sort passing the ssDNA into the pore, something like helicase.\n\nScrew Sanger for casually receiving two Nobels. I hate geniuses."

    "text": "I used Quarto, which was recommended to me by a friend for its simplicity and ease of management. I could have used any number of other tools to build the website for greater customization, but I don’t sweat the details; the uncouth aesthetics of a website don’t bring me much displeasure. I’m also lazy, which I suppose is the real reason.\nWhat I did to deploy my website is by no means special, so writing about this process is merely a way for me to fully understand it.\nTo customize the website to my needs (though it is still a bleak website and may eventually require an update), I made a few adjustments to the styles.css file, including—but not limited to—setting the font, making the TOC and navbar sticky, and adding page transition animations. As for the theme specified in the configuration file, I simply built the website off the “lightly” theme.\nI hosted the website on GitHub Pages but bought a custom domain, so the DNS records needed to point to four A records that connect to GitHub’s servers. From there, a CNAME record points to my GitHub Page. Then, all I needed to do was tell GitHub that I had a custom domain ready.\nRather than publishing from the main branch, I set up a separate branch, gh-pages, and published from there. This keeps the repo clean: I can isolate the build artifacts in that branch and deploy from there, relieving the main branch of unnecessary clutter. _site is also included in .gitignore to reduce clutter on the main branch, ensuring that only actual edits are visible in the version history.\nThat concludes the mechanics behind the website. I’m sure I’ve mentioned this on the home page, but this website is primarily a way for me to put what I learn into words, which I hope will aid the learning process. I’ll continue doing this with other subjects of interest."

The liver then oxidizes FFAs, turning them into ketones, which can be used for energy in the absence of glucose. This is called ketogenesis. If the rate of ketogenesis exceeds the rate of consumption by peripheral tissues, ketones accumulate in the blood (ketonemia), leading to metabolic acidosis.\nMetabolic acidosis is often accompanied by an increase in respiratory rate to blow off CO₂, which helps raise blood pH. It’s interesting how insulin deficiency can ultimately lead to something that may seem completely unrelated at first."

Sustained osmotic diuresis in the absence of metabolic acidosis can cause hyperosmolar nonketotic coma. Because symptoms like rapid respiration don’t appear, it’s hard to recognize the severity of this condition until the late stages of dehydration, especially if the patient is already impaired and fails to hydrate. The hyperosmolarity eventually draws water out of brain cells, potentially causing coma."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This short informal post is long overdue, but I’ll excuse myself since this website wasn’t up and running in June, when I attended the conference—and besides, I’ve been busy with other things.\nI had the chance to attend ASM 2025 in LA back in June. I presented my findings along with my lab partner, and overall I’d say it was a pretty good experience.\nBefore this, my lab partner and I had attended a smaller research conference in January. That conference was made up mainly of undergraduates. Many disciplines from the biological sciences were represented—everything from ecology to biochemistry. Since we were all undergrads, I found it easier to walk up to posters and ask as many questions as I wanted to satisfy my curiosity, because it was mutually understood that none of us really knew much about each other’s disciplines. It was nice in this way; you could pull the “I’m ignorant just like you, help me out” card, even though any basic lack of knowledge is really my own fault.\nRegardless, no one was really in a higher academic caste than you, and you could explore each other’s projects as fellow undergrads and come up with questions to ask—questions that would puzzle both parties in which we’d go home after the conference and try to answer them.\nI enjoyed the undergrad conference quite a bit, which is probably a testament to how little I know about my own field, given that I wasn’t bored. But in my defense, most of the students who attended were genuinely interested in what they did (above average, I’d say) and were more than happy to explain their findings.\nBut back to ASM 2025, the main subject of this post, which took place five months after the undergrad conference. ASM is made up of graduate students but mainly PhDs, so going into it I thought I’d feel a crippling sense of academic inferiority—which was somewhat true, but not the whole story.\nIt is most definitely true—without exception, or any further consideration—that I know absolutely nothing in comparison to the majority of people that attended the conference. The sheer amount of knowledge some of them possessed astonished me. We had a few people visit our poster, including some who had been part of Dr. Yep’s lab during her fellowship days, who asked the most pointed questions, as if they had been part of the project all along. I recognize the level of devotion, curiosity, and gratification it takes to know so much about a single subject. It amazed me to imagine an entire conference full of people like this. Naturally, I found it difficult to ask the questions I was harboring, afraid I’d be condemned over my ignorance.\nI guess what I’m trying to say is this: imagine being the only person in the world who possesses a particular piece of knowledge—something you yourself discovered. You’d be the sole expert in that niche. To be number one in something so hyperspecific, with everyone flocking to you for your insight, is absolutely insane to me.\nI’m not the brightest (I’m at the very least, bright enough to know that), and places like this make you realize that. I’m not planning on a career in academia, but I suspect I’ll run into people like this wherever I go. I admire that quality, and seeing people like that encourages me to obsess more over the pursuit of knowledge, even though I’m still very far from it. And I suppose the prospect of possessing vast amounts of knowledge gives me a nice feeling."

    "text": "Introduction to Infection and Motility\nIn order to introduce the purpose of the project, one must first learn the necessary background information. The subject can be introduced by learning about the mechanism of colonization to induce infection.\nCFT073 is a strain of Escherichia coli known widely to be the main cause of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). Infection is heavily dependent on the bacterial flagella, suggested to contribute to virulence by enabling UPEC to disseminate throughout urinary tract and escape host immune responses (Lane et al. 2005).\nfliC, the cistron that codes for flagellin, is the main component of the bacterial flagella, as lesions in cistron F of region III result in loss of ability to produce flagellin (Silverman and Simon n.d.). Cistron F was later renamed fliC.\nSo when the deletion of fliC, the gene domain, is made, the absence of flagella is induced, so we expect to see a complete loss in motility, which is what was observed in the fliC deletion mutant (Lane et al. 2005). The deletion of the gene rendered the mutant completely non-motile, severely compromising virulence.\nNaturally, it would follow that studying the inhibition of CFT073 motility could lead to novel ways of treating UTIs."

    "section": "Why do we study Iron?",
    "text": "Why do we study Iron?\nIt has been known since the dawn of bacteriology that iron is an essential nutrient facilitating the survival of the E. coli cell.\nThe importance of iron is understood but the specific reason for its importance reveals itself in the role iron plays as a cofactor. There are specific enzymes within the citric acid cycle that require iron as a cofactor for proper catalysis and therefore, energy production. We expect depletion of iron to negatively impact growth.\nWe know how iron impacts growth, but we have not yet understood its impacts on motility.\nThe deletion of the Fur (ferric uptake repressor) expressed an excess of iron intracellularly (McHugh et al. 2003). Fur was proven to be a master regulator of iron dependent uptake systems and the synthesis of conjugated proteins with iron as its prosthetic group. Under iron repleted conditions, fur binds to iron, attaching itself to the furbox upstream of iron-related genes, restricting the amount of iron imported into the cell and allowing production of conjugated proteins. Conversely, under iron depleted conditions, fur falls off the furbox, allowing the uptake of iron and decreasing the production of conjugated proteins.\nMotility happens to be one of the genes that is affected by the Fur repression. There is evidence that the Fe2+-Fur complex also represses genes (cyoA, flbB, fumC, gpmA, metH, nohB, purR, and sodA) involved in various noniron functions (respiration, flagella chemotaxis, the TCA cycle) (McHugh et al. 2003).\n\nWhy not explore other nutrients?\nIron concentration is, under normal conditions, very restricted in the urinary tract. It is therefore one of the limiting nutrients in the environment of infection.\nIron content of human urine is normally very low (∼0.1 μmol per liter) in the uninfected state. Even in the absence of inﬂammatory stimuli, iron is subject to tight physiologic control (Robinson, Heffernan, and Henderson 2018).\nThe idea behind understanding iron lies in the fact that iron concentration in the urinary tract is already very low. So when thinking of treatment options, a provider should be considering iron availability as a possible factor contributing to virulence."

    "text": "Modes of Motility Expressed by CFT073\nThere are generally three modes of motility, hence avenues for virulence, expressed by CFT073 that we are concerned with: swimming, swarming, and biofilm formation. Inhibition of these virulence factors should decrease the likelihood, and if not, severity of infection.\n\nSwimming\nIndependent movement of the cells. The kind of motility we are all familiar with; powered by rotating flagella. This mode of motility is required to swim up the urethra into the bladder, and in severe cases, required to travel up the ureter to the kidneys (Lane et al. 2005).\n\n\nSwarming\nConcerted, multicellular, and energy intense raft-like movement across semi-solid surfaces. Also powered by rotating flagella. Involves quorum sensing. In catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs), swarming motility is oftentimes employed to travel up the catheter into the bladder, though most studies that looked at this possibility used Proteus mirabilis as the model uropathogen. (Jones et al. 2004).\n\n\nBiofilm Formation\nMatrix of extracellular polymeric substances protecting the pathogen from potentially harmful external conditions, facilitating attachment of the colony. Major causative agent of recurrent infections. Attachment is vital since the human bladder is emptied every couple hours, requiring the pathogen to attach itself to the bladder walls for successful infection (Yang et al. 2016).\nIn addition to modifying the availability of extracellular iron, we are also looking at 2 mutants which have different iron acquisition capabilities. ∆tonB has low intracellular iron since the import of iron is compromised with the deletion of a crucial component of the iron acquisition system. ∆fur has high intracellular iron because the repressor is lacking, hence, allowing for as much iron import via systems like TonB-ExbB-ExbD to occur."
