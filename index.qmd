I'm an undergraduate studying Microbiology at [California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Polytechnic_State_University,_San_Luis_Obispo). 

I'm enjoy learning about pathogenesis, mutualistic host-microbe relationships, and anything medicine related, but I also do some computer science (nominally) in the lab. Learn more in the [research section](research.qmd).

The [blog section](blog.qmd) is simply a place where I learn about whatever I want.
