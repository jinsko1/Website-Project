    "title": "LB, ∆fur, and Stationary Phase",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dr. Yep noticed how ∆fur stalled earlier than the other strains. It’s not necessarily a problem, but I’d like to understand the cause. The paper should also explain this, so we’ll need the rationale anyway.\n∆fur entered stationary phase early in Lysogeny Broth (LB). This didn’t happen with any of the other strains or media. Why? I’ll attempt to explain this in a few ways.\n\nROS Damage\nSince this phenomenon was absent in all other media, I think the early stalling most likely reflects a specific interaction between the high intracellular iron characteristic of ∆fur, and some inherent property of LB.\nThere appears to be commercial variance in background ROS in LB. LB (Sigma) tends to have more H2O2 than LB (Difco), which is generally gentler (I’m fairly confident we use Sigma). Together with constitutively elevated intracellular iron (Fenton reaction), ∆fur may also be exposed to higher levels of peroxide, causing ROS damage. Components such as riboflavin, reducing sugars, and transition metal ions—present in LB—can generate ROS depending on storage conditions, especially with light exposure (Ezraty et al. 2014).\nNote that ∆fur is easily pushed into oxidative stress as well. Deletion of fur indirectly represses sodB, which encodes iron superoxide dismutase. This enzyme acts as an antioxidant, preventing ROS damage. But in ∆fur, this antioxidant is repressed. Cells must then rely on the product of sodA (manganese superoxide dismutase), and, unfortunately, if Mn is lacking in the environment, there isn’t much the cell can do to prevent ROS damage (Chareyre and Mandin 2018).\nSide note: although it wasn’t exactly stationary phase, there was some growth inhibition with ∆fur in swarming medium as well. Both LB and swarming medium contain yeast extract, which may include components necessary for ROS generation. Of course, this perceived symmetry may be coincidental, and some other intrinsic characteristic attributable to the mutation may be at play; I’m only speculating.\n\n\npH Threshold\nThe effect seen in ∆fur is most likely due to various reasons in combination, including pH damage. One other thing I suspect is the pH threshold of E. coli since LB isn’t really buffered, so left alone, growth can take the media up to a pH of 9 without glucose (swarming media has glucose, which may be why CFT doesn’t top out in swarming media.) Excretion of excess ammonia is to blame for the alkalinization (Sezonov, Joseleau-Petit, and D’Ari 2007).\n\n\nCarbon Exhaustion\nThis one is pretty simple. Since LB is pretty limited terms of its nutrient content, lack of carbon sources in combination with the preceding reasons may account for the early stalling observed for ∆fur in LB (Sezonov, Joseleau-Petit, and D’Ari 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChareyre, Sylvia, and Pierre Mandin. 2018. “Bacterial Iron Homeostasis Regulation by sRNAs.” Microbiology Spectrum 6 (2): 10.1128/microbiolspec.rwr-0010-2017. https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.rwr-0010-2017.\n\n\nEzraty, Benjamin, Camille Henry, Marion Hérisse, Erick Denamur, and Frédéric Barras. 2014. “Commercial Lysogeny Broth Culture Media and Oxidative Stress: A Cautious Tale.” Free Radical Biology and Medicine 74 (September): 245–51. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.07.010.\n\n\nSezonov, Guennadi, Danièle Joseleau-Petit, and Richard D’Ari. 2007. “Escherichia Coli Physiology in Luria-Bertani Broth.” Journal of Bacteriology 189 (23): 8746–49. https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.01368-07."

    "text": "In the lab, Kelsey and I have been running into issues with the biofilm assay. Regardless of the incubation period, the E. coli strains that are supposed to form biofilms aren’t doing so. After a couple of failed attempts, we also tried growing Pseudomonas, which is known for robust biofilm formation, but this trial also resulted in no observable biofilm. By testing these two strains, we could assess whether the problem lies with the E. coli strains we were using or whether it stems from a systemic error in our protocol.\nGiven the fact that Pseudomonas also failed to form observable biofilms, we concluded that the error most likely originates in the protocol. Since I’ve never done this before, in the subsequent passages I attempt to explicate and justify the steps in the biofilm procedure and where we might have erred."

Add 125 μL of a 0.1% solution of crystal violet to each well. Incubate the microtiter plate at room temperature for 10-15 min. Rinse the plate 3-4 times with water by submerging in a tub of water as outlined above, shake out and blot vigorously on a stack of paper towels to rid the plate of all excess cells and dye.

In any case, here are potential errors that may have occurred based on the procedure above:\n\nWashing and Rinsing\nIn the current procedure, we aspirate the supernatant rather than dumping it.

The liver then oxidizes FFAs, turning them into ketones, which can be used for energy in the absence of glucose. This is called ketogenesis. If the rate of ketogenesis exceeds the rate of consumption by peripheral tissues, ketones accumulate in the blood (ketonemia), leading to metabolic acidosis.\nMetabolic acidosis is often accompanied by an increase in respiratory rate to blow off CO₂, which helps raise blood pH. It’s interesting how insulin deficiency can ultimately lead to something that may seem completely unrelated at first."

    "section": "1st Gen Sequencing",
    "text": "1st Gen Sequencing\nDideoxy gene sequencing uses what is called “primed synthesis” for sequencing. Primed synthesis works as follows: primers anneal onto a denatured strand of DNA, yielding ssDNA and creating a free 3’-OH group. A DNA polymerase then binds to the oligonucleotide primer, copying the remainder of the template strand. Understanding this mechanism is important for understanding the later stages of sequencing.\nTo sequence a specific section of the genome, the DNA sequence in question is cloned via PCR. This ensures the proper strength of the signal on the autoradiograph later on. The DNA duplex is then denatured, and primers are annealed. The Klenow fragment then synthesizes the copy of the template strand. The Klenow fragment is used instead of DNA polymerase I because the fragment lacks the 5’→3’ endonuclease function. This ensures the primer is not digested when the polymerase is introduced to the sample.\nWithin the test tubes, along with the dNTPs used to elongate the daughter strand, one type of ddNTP is included in low concentrations, hence the name “dideoxy” sequencing. The ddNTPs are missing the 3’-OH group, disallowing elongation of the strand as phosphodiester bonds aren’t allowed to form. The concentrations of ddNTPs are kept low to ensure that termination of the daughter strand does not happen too often. This is done four times in four different test tubes to create fragments that terminate at corresponding nucleotides.\nAs a result, nested fragments are formed. These are fragments of DNA that differ in length due to the random incorporation of ddNTPs. You can run these fragments along a four-channel agarose gel (each channel corresponds to a test tube with a specific ddNTP), usually with urea and high temperature to ensure denaturing conditions. You don’t want secondary structures to interfere with the distance traveled by the fragments.\nYou can then take the gel and expose it onto a film to create the autoradiograph. Reading this is pretty simple: just read the film from the bottom up. Keep your eyes peeled for minuscule differences between the base pairs across the four channels. First-generation sequencing is pretty accurate and is still used today; it is the gold standard of sequencing due to its accuracy."

    "text": "NGS\nNGS stands for next-generation sequencing.\nAfter dideoxy sequencing was developed, large-scale sequencing consisted of large machines in increasingly larger buildings. This was obviously not very cost-effective, and scientists needed a different approach to sequencing.\nWhile second-generation sequencing requires the amplification of identical fragments via PCR, third-gen sequencing does not, eliminating any errors that may arise at this stage. For both generations, you can use two types of gene libraries: Fragment libraries, which are produced via sonication of the genome, or amplicon libraries, which are produced via PCR of a certain subsection of the genome. Naturally, since you are targeting the entire genome, there is less coverage (less likelihood of sequencing a certain base pair) with fragment libraries. Fragment libraries are more probability-based than amplicon libraries since fragment libraries cover a larger area. To fix this, you could increase the depth of the read, but that’s more work. Under normal circumstances, one achieves what they need from an amplicon library that tells them something about a specific gene of interest or a subsection of the genome. The ends of the fragments are usually edited so that detection of the fragments becomes possible.\nThird-gen sequencing is more interesting to me, so I’ll talk about that and skip second-gen, though I feel a bit bad (not really). This type of sequencing has absolutely no semblance to 1st-gen (Dideoxy sequencing).\n\nSMRT Sequencing\nSMRT stands for Single-Molecule Real-Time sequencing.\nThe contraption used for sequencing consists of a DNA polymerase attached to the bottom of zero-mode waveguides (very small wells), approximately 100 nm in diameter. A strand of ssDNA is then passed into the well, along with dNTP-fl (fluorophore-labeled dNTPs). From the bottom of the well, an excitatory wavelength is shot out, so when the ssDNA incorporates the dNTP-fl as its daughter strand, a wavelength of light is emitted specific to the nucleotide, allowing for sequencing. It helps to have the zero-mode waveguide so small to dampen any background noise.\nNote that if you are passing a linear sequence of DNA through the ZMW, the accuracy tends to be pretty low. Instead, adaptors are added to the ends of the DNA to make the fragment of DNA circular. This allows for repetition of reads, increasing the depth of sequencing. You could technically just throw a linear sequence in, but accuracy goes down real fast; something like 99.9% to 87%.\n\n\nNanopore Sequencing\nThis is the most modern type of third-gen sequencing. The smallest version of this device can be held in your palm and be plugged into a computer. This particular piece of technology consists of a membrane with embedded nanopores, usually constructed of proteins. A voltage is applied across this polymer membrane, and a current is created in the nanopore. When an ssDNA strand passes through this nanopore, small disturbances in the current are detected. These disturbances can be discerned from each other due to the different sizes of the nitrogenous bases. A sequence can then be generated with the disturbances plotted on a graph.\nAn adaptor sequence is added onto the strand to improve entry into the nanopore. There’s usually a motor protein of some sort passing the ssDNA into the pore, something like helicase."

And Ove realised that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life.\n\n\n\nAnton Chekhov\n\nI realized that when you love someone, your reasoning about that love should be based on what is supreme, on what is more important than happiness or unhappiness, sin or virtue, in the way that they are usually understood, otherwise it is not worth reasoning at all.\n\n\n\nOsamu Dazai\n\nTo wait. In our lives we know joy, anger, sorrow, and a hundred other emotions, but these emotions all together occupy a bare one per cent of our time. The remaining ninety-nine per cent is just living in waiting. I wait in momentary expectation, feeling as though my breasts are being crushed, for the sound in the corridor of the footsteps of happiness. Empty. Oh, life is too painful, the reality that confirms the universal belief that it is best not to be born.\n\n\nAs long as you love me, all I want is to spend my whole life by your side.\n\n\n\nF.

It’s when you can’t even feel pain anymore that you’re in real trouble.\n\n\nIt is not that the meaning cannot be explained. But there are certain meanings that are lost forever the moment they are explained in words.\n\n\nIf I had remained at home, I would have spent my life waiting for you to get in touch. And a life spent waiting would mean I couldn’t think of anything other than you. Of course, I wouldn’t mind. Since you were what I wanted in this world, more than anything.\n\n\nWe each have a special something we can get only at a special time of our life. Like a small flame. A careful, fortunate few cherish that flame, nurture it, hold it as a torch to light their way. But once that flame goes out, it’s gone forever.\n\n\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\nIn the face of pain there are no heroes.\n\n\n\nAnn Patchett\n\nHe was in love, and never had he felt such kindness towards another person. Never had he received such kindness. Maybe the private life wasn’t forever. Maybe everyone got it for a little while and then spend the rest of their lives remembering.\n\n\nOnly a few of us are going to be willing to break our own hearts by trading in the living beauty of imagination for the stark disappointment of words.\n\n\n\nJ. D. Salinger\n\nMany, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You’ll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It’s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn’t education. It’s history. It’s poetry. I’m not trying to tell you that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world. It’s not so. But I do say that educated and scholarly men, if they’re brilliant and creative to begin with—which, unfortunately, is rarely the case—tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative. They tend to express themselves more clearly, and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end.\n\n\n“Anyway, I like it now,” I said. “I mean right now. Sitting here with you and just chewing the fat and horsing—”\n“That isn’t anything really!”\n“It is so something really! Certainly it is! Why the hell isn’t it?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Most antagonism doesn’t need contact. Bacteria just secrete stuff into the environment—for instance, specific bacteriocins and broad antibiotics. These diffuse and hit any nearby cells that don’t have the right resistance or immunity. This is a great example of long-range killing, with no direct contact needed (Willey et al. 2020).\nType V secretion system: the cell has a huge outer-membrane protein, CdiA, exported by CdiB. The N-terminal part of CdiA binds a specific receptor on the target cell. The C-terminal part (CdiA-CT) is the toxin domain that actually goes into the target and does the damage (DNase, RNase, translation block, etc.). The producing cell makes a small immunity protein, CdiI, that binds its own CdiA-CT and blocks it. So, if you have the matching cdiI gene, you’re safe; if not, you get killed (Klein, Ahmad, and Whitney 2020).\nType VI secretion system: basically a phage-like tube and sheath built into the envelope. The sheath contracts and pushes a harpoon into the neighboring cell envelope. Attached to that are effectors that cut peptidoglycan, damage membranes, or attack nucleic acids. Each effector has a cognate immunity protein in the attacker (periplasm or cytosol, depending on where the toxin acts), so the self is protected whilst neighbors without matching immunity are not (Klein, Ahmad, and Whitney 2020).\nType IV secretion system: this is the conjugation / DNA-transfer machine used in plasmid transfer. In an antagonism context, the donor uses the same channel at the contact site to move toxic proteins or DNA directly into the recipient. Who gets targeted depends on which cells the T4SS can dock to, and what payload is being delivered. Again, killing only happens at close contact because the transfer channel has to form between the two cells (Klein, Ahmad, and Whitney 2020).\nType VII secretion system (Gram-positives, T7SSb): a cluster of membrane proteins (Ess/Yuk, etc.) forms the export machinery. It secretes small toxins and larger toxins. These larger toxins act on nearby Gram-positive cells (membrane, cell wall, other essential targets). The toxin genes usually sit right next to a small immunity gene; if you carry both, you’re protected; if you’re a close relative missing that cassette, you’re at risk (Klein, Ahmad, and Whitney 2020).\nAt this point, it’s only natural to ask why there are multiple secretion systems. There’s the evolutionary answer: different lineages started from different “starting parts” (phage tails, conjugation systems, autotransporters) and solved the same problem in parallel. But cell envelope structure matters too: Gram-negatives with an outer membrane can support a T6SS; Gram-positives use T7SS instead. On top of that, the ecology is different: sometimes you want a very specific receptor-based hit (Type V), sometimes a more general protein-injection system (T6, T7), sometimes you care more about moving DNA than just poisoning (T4). Each system has its own range, targets, and style of immunity, so bacteria end up with a set of tools that cover different situations. That is, these aren’t superfluous mechanisms of antagonism (Willey et al. 2020).\nInterestingly, there’s a paper that shows a proof-of-concept on the implementation of secretion systems. Yim and Wang show how one can repurpose these weapons and actually use them on specified bacterial communities (Yim and Wang 2021). The actual paper referenced within Yim and Wang showed an engineered T6SS that uses nanobody binders (small, engineered antibody fragments) to focus killing of specific strains, among other reinventions (Ting et al. 2020). One might find this confusing since T6SS does not require specific antibodies for killing under normal circumstances, as explained. The antibody on the attacker binds to the antigen on the target so they stay glued together long enough for the T6SS to fire into the target, instead of whoever happens to be nearby. The killing assays of E. coli were on the order of 570-fold and 220-fold with antibody targeting, versus only ~6-fold and ~3-fold when they used a control strain without antibody targeting.\nAt this point, it seems like a good idea to implement this within clinical trials to fight infection, but before that, there are several important considerations to make (these are merely inferences).\nIf the antigen being targeted were even partially expressed by commensals, one would run the risk of killing these beneficial species off by proxy. Also, dropping an engineered species into a host chock-full of bacteria is not the greatest idea, considering the risk of hypervirulence via mechanisms like HGT.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKlein, Timothy A., Shehryar Ahmad, and John C.

    "text": "I used Quarto, which was recommended to me by a friend for its simplicity and ease of management. I could have used any number of other tools to build the website for greater customization, but I don’t sweat the details; the uncouth aesthetics of a website don’t bring me much displeasure. I’m also lazy, which I suppose is the real reason.\nWhat I did to deploy my website is by no means special, so writing about this process is merely a way for me to fully understand it.\nTo customize the website to my needs (though it is still a bleak website and may eventually require an update), I made a few adjustments to the styles.css file, including—but not limited to—setting the font, making the TOC and navbar sticky, and adding page transition animations. As for the theme specified in the configuration file, I simply built the website off the “lightly” theme.\nI hosted the website on GitHub Pages but bought a custom domain, so the DNS records needed to point to four A records that connect to GitHub’s servers. From there, a CNAME record points to my GitHub Page. Then, all I needed to do was tell GitHub that I had a custom domain ready.\nRather than publishing from the main branch, I set up a separate branch, gh-pages, and published from there. This keeps the repo clean: I can isolate the build artifacts in that branch and deploy from there, relieving the main branch of unnecessary clutter. _site is also included in .gitignore to reduce clutter on the main branch, ensuring that only actual edits are visible in the version history.\nThat concludes the mechanics behind the website. I’m sure I’ve mentioned this on the home page, but this website is primarily a way for me to put what I learn into words, which I hope will aid the learning process. I’ll continue doing this with other subjects of interest."

    "title": "SPICES Model of Medical Education",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I enjoy reading about medicine. I figured I should read about how medicine should be learnt. What follows is an argument for the more liberal forms of the SPICES model of medical education (Harden, Sowden, and Dunn 1984). The paper itself is relatively old, but many medical schools, especially in the States, have still not seriously re-evaluated their curriculum. Even though newer schools tend to be more liberal in their approach, the inertia of older programs makes the framework oddly current, and therefore still relevant.\nThe SPICES model is a way of describing a curriculum by placing it on six continua. The acronym stands for student-centered versus teacher-centered learning, problem-based versus information-gathering learning, integrated versus discipline-based teaching, community-based versus hospital-based education, electives versus a standard programme, and systematic versus apprenticeship or opportunistic training. The point is not that every school must live at one extreme, but that schools should be honest about where they sit and whether that position makes sense.\n\nStudent-centered vs Teacher-centered Learning\nStudent-centered learning makes more sense to me. In its simplest form, it means the student has real responsibility over what gets learned and how, rather than acting as a passive receiver of whatever the instructor decides to deliver. It shifts the emphasis from teaching as performance to learning as an activity. I may not always wish to be taught, but I do wish to learn; the paper referenced a line like this attributed to Churchill, and it captures the difference well. What matters in education is what the students learn, not what the teacher teaches. If you actually believe that, then you should prefer a model that makes the learner do the work of learning.\nThe arguments for the student-centered approach are not complicated. It makes learning active rather than passive, and it trains the habit that matters most in medicine: the ability to identify what you don’t know and then go out of your way to fix it. It also allows the student to learn in a way that can actually be efficient for them rather than being forced into a one-size-fits-all method that cannot be guaranteed valuable on the instructor side. Besides, learning on your own is simply more fun. You get to do it your own way, and you get to chase coherence instead of pretending that compliance is understanding.\nThe objections to student-centered learning tend to be weak. One objection is that many teachers have only experienced a teacher-centered approach. My objection is that this is not a valid argument against the principles of student-centered learning. It’s an argument that the familiar approach is convenient, not that it is better. Education should never be treated with such obstinance. Another objection is that students may be apprehensive because their previous experience was teacher-centered. My objection is harsher: if you’ve never gone out of your way to learn on your own and you feel threatened by the idea, in your lack of curiosity, you don’t deserve to be educated. Deal with it. Physicians have a moral obligation to learn for their patients without being spoon-fed—keeping up with literature, relearning what time has eroded, and updating what evidence overturns. If you can’t do that, don’t become a physician. Student-centered learning emphasizes exactly this form of active learning, and that is why I argue for it very liberally.\n\n\nProblem-based Learning vs Information-gathering Model\nI also argue for problem-based learning over the information-gathering model. Problem-based learning means starting with a problem or condition and using that as the engine that determines what you need to learn, so that basic sciences are pulled in as tools for explanation. The information-gathering model goes the other way: you accumulate foundational facts first, usually sorted by discipline, and only later apply them to conditions. When problem solving in the hospital or clinic, clinical reasoning should trace a path that begins with manifestations—lab tests, symptoms, radiology—and then moves toward potential causes grounded in the basic sciences. Manifestation leads you to mechanism. That aligns naturally with problem-based learning, where you meet the condition first and then learn the causes through a deeper dive, which forces the foundational sciences to become meaningful rather than decorative.\nThe information-gathering model feels backwards to me. It moves from basic sciences to conditions and asks the student to trust that relevance will appear later. I don’t understand the logic behind this as a default. It feels like a convenient and lossy curriculum derived from textbooks that are demarcated by subject matter, rather than an attempt at an integrated and coherent curriculum. Problem-based learning also helps eliminate superfluous information, because every piece of foundational science you learn should be required for a full explanation. It is far too common within education to learn unnecessary information simply because it exists, not because it is needed.\nThe common objections to problem-based learning are also predictable. One is that you need a solid foundation first, and vocabulary matters, as emphasized in the information-gathering model. I don’t understand why you can’t do this within problem-based learning. If you dive deep enough into any clinical problem, you will always find the foundations, and you will learn more than enough to explain pathological phenomena. And vocabulary is easy. Learn the medical Latin and Greek roots and you’re good; it isn’t too difficult to intuit what a structure or process is once you break the word into its component roots. Another objection is that problem-based learning places a heavy load on instructors because it requires well-prepared, integrated material aligned with problem solving. That’s understandable, but it’s not an argument against the principles of problem-based learning. It’s an argument for the avoidance of such practices, which is a different thing.\n\n\nIntegreated vs Discipline-based Teaching\nIn the same vein, I argue for integrated teaching rather than discipline-based teaching. Discipline-based teaching segments medicine into separate subjects—anatomy here, physiology there, pathology somewhere else—and then expects the student to assemble the overall picture on their own. Integrated teaching attempts to interrelate these areas deliberately so that the student is not forced to do all the synthesis after the fact. Integration can be horizontal, meaning integration across disciplines at the same stage, like learning anatomy and physiology together within a system, or vertical, meaning integration across time, linking basic sciences with clinical thinking rather than pretending basic science ends when the clinic begins. The integrated approach aligns with problem solving because adequate explanations for real conditions usually require multiple disciplines at once. The body does not respect departmental boundaries, so education should stop acting like it does.\nOne of the better points the paper makes is that integration promotes communication between instructors across disciplines. It forces them to think about the overall aims of the curriculum and of the school rather than being limited to their own departments. That shift matters. Departments have incentives to defend their subject-matter territory, but students need coherent models, not territorial claims. Integration is one way to force the curriculum to admit that coherence is the actual goal.\nThere is, however, one objection to integration that I take seriously: it can be lossy. Since the integrated approach focuses less on the individual subjects and argues for a holistic approach, some information is bound to be lost. Whether that loss is dangerous is another debate, but the possibility is real. The omission of topics must be closely monitored, because “integration” is not a license to be sloppy. Another objection is that teachers are often more passionate about their own subjects, which could decrease enthusiasm in an integrated structure. Even if that happens, instructors should still be able to see the overlap between their own field and other fields, and they should be capable of teaching their piece as part of a whole. Another objection is that integration may induce uncertainty about which specialty a student should choose. I don’t understand the basis of this argument. Specialty choice is not based on book learning alone; it is shaped by experiences during rotations, mentorship, temperament, and the realities of daily work.\n\n\nCommunity-based vs Hospital-based\nI argue for the community-based approach over the hospital-based approach, but this is simpler than the other debates. Hospital-based education concentrates pathology and acute care, but community-based education is closer to the actual distribution of medicine: prevention, chronic disease, early presentation, follow-up, and the social context that determines whether treatment matters. If you train only in hospitals, you risk confusing the most intense slice of medicine for the whole of medicine. Community-based education corrects that distortion.\n\n\nElective vs Uniform\nI also argue briefly for an elective-based curriculum. Electives add an element of responsibility and ownership, and they acknowledge that students do not all need the same depth in the same places at the same time. They allow exploration and the pursuit of specific interests without pretending that a uniform programme can optimize for every future physician. A standard core is necessary, but a purely standard programme assumes a single path, and medicine does not reward that assumption.\n\n\nSystematic vs Apprenticeship\nFinally, I argue for a systematic approach over the apprenticeship or opportunistic approach, because uniform coverage matters. Opportunistic learning depends on chance: which patients arrive, which cases happen to be on the ward, which attending happens to teach, and how service pressures distort teaching. A systematic curriculum is a commitment to ensuring that required experiences and competencies are covered rather than left to luck. In real medical settings, gaps are not just personal deficiencies; they become risks that bleed into patient care. If education is supposed to be ethical, then it cannot rely on accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarden, R. M., Susette Sowden, and W. R.

    "text": "This short informal post is long overdue, but I’ll excuse myself since this website wasn’t up and running in June, when I attended the conference—and besides, I’ve been busy with other things.\nI had the chance to attend ASM 2025 in LA back in June. I presented my findings along with my lab partner, and overall I’d say it was a pretty good experience.\nBefore this, my lab partner and I had attended a smaller research conference in January. That conference was made up mainly of undergraduates. Many disciplines from the biological sciences were represented—everything from ecology to biochemistry. Since we were all undergrads, I found it easier to walk up to posters and ask as many questions as I wanted to satisfy my curiosity, because it was mutually understood that none of us really knew much about each other’s disciplines. It was nice in this way; you could pull the “I’m ignorant just like you, help me out” card, even though any basic lack of knowledge is really my own fault.\nRegardless, no one was really in a higher academic caste than you, and you could explore each other’s projects as fellow undergrads and come up with questions to ask—questions that would puzzle both parties in which we’d go home after the conference and try to answer them.\nI enjoyed the undergrad conference quite a bit, which is probably a testament to how little I know about my own field, given that I wasn’t bored. But in my defense, most of the students who attended were genuinely interested in what they did (above average, I’d say) and were more than happy to explain their findings.\nBut back to ASM 2025, the main subject of this post, which took place five months after the undergrad conference. ASM is made up of graduate students but mainly PhDs, so going into it I thought I’d feel a crippling sense of academic inferiority—which was somewhat true, but not the whole story.\nIt is most definitely true—without exception, or any further consideration—that I know absolutely nothing in comparison to the majority of people that attended the conference. The sheer amount of knowledge some of them possessed astonished me. We had a few people visit our poster, including some who had been part of Dr. Yep’s lab during her fellowship days, who asked the most pointed questions, as if they had been part of the project all along. I recognize the level of devotion, curiosity, and gratification it takes to know so much about a single subject. It amazed me to imagine an entire conference full of people like this. Naturally, I found it difficult to ask the questions I was harboring, afraid I’d be condemned over my ignorance.\nI guess what I’m trying to say is this: imagine being the only person in the world who possesses a particular piece of knowledge—something you yourself discovered. You’d be the sole expert in that niche. To be number one in something so hyperspecific, with everyone flocking to you for your insight, is absolutely insane to me.\nI’m not the brightest (I’m at the very least, bright enough to know that), and places like this make you realize that. I’m not planning on a career in academia, but I suspect I’ll run into people like this wherever I go. I admire that quality, and seeing people like that encourages me to obsess more over the pursuit of knowledge, even though I’m still very far from it. And I suppose the prospect of possessing vast amounts of knowledge gives me a nice feeling."

    "text": "Introduction to Infection and Motility\nIn order to introduce the purpose of the project, one must first learn the necessary background information. The subject can be introduced by learning about the mechanism of colonization to induce infection.\nCFT073 is a strain of Escherichia coli known widely to be the main cause of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). Infection is heavily dependent on the bacterial flagella, suggested to contribute to virulence by enabling UPEC to disseminate throughout urinary tract and escape host immune responses (Lane et al. 2005).\nfliC, the cistron that codes for flagellin, is the main component of the bacterial flagella, as lesions in cistron F of region III result in loss of ability to produce flagellin (Silverman and Simon n.d.). Cistron F was later renamed fliC.\nSo when the deletion of fliC, the gene domain, is made, the absence of flagella is induced, so we expect to see a complete loss in motility, which is what was observed in the fliC deletion mutant (Lane et al. 2005). The deletion of the gene rendered the mutant completely non-motile, severely compromising virulence.\nNaturally, it would follow that studying the inhibition of CFT073 motility could lead to novel ways of treating UTIs."

    "section": "Why do we study Iron?",
    "text": "Why do we study Iron?\nIt has been known since the dawn of bacteriology that iron is an essential nutrient facilitating the survival of the E. coli cell.\nThe importance of iron is understood but the specific reason for its importance reveals itself in the role iron plays as a cofactor. There are specific enzymes within the citric acid cycle that require iron as a cofactor for proper catalysis and therefore, energy production. We expect depletion of iron to negatively impact growth.\nWe know how iron impacts growth, but we have not yet understood its impacts on motility.\nThe deletion of the Fur (ferric uptake repressor) expressed an excess of iron intracellularly (McHugh et al. 2003). Fur was proven to be a master regulator of iron dependent uptake systems and the synthesis of conjugated proteins with iron as its prosthetic group. Under iron repleted conditions, fur binds to iron, attaching itself to the furbox upstream of iron-related genes, restricting the amount of iron imported into the cell and allowing production of conjugated proteins. Conversely, under iron depleted conditions, fur falls off the furbox, allowing the uptake of iron and decreasing the production of conjugated proteins.\nMotility happens to be one of the genes that is affected by the Fur repression. There is evidence that the Fe2+-Fur complex also represses genes (cyoA, flbB, fumC, gpmA, metH, nohB, purR, and sodA) involved in various noniron functions (respiration, flagella chemotaxis, the TCA cycle) (McHugh et al. 2003).\n\nWhy not explore other nutrients?\nIron concentration is, under normal conditions, very restricted in the urinary tract. It is therefore one of the limiting nutrients in the environment of infection.\nIron content of human urine is normally very low (∼0.1 μmol per liter) in the uninfected state. Even in the absence of inﬂammatory stimuli, iron is subject to tight physiologic control (Robinson, Heffernan, and Henderson 2018).\nThe idea behind understanding iron lies in the fact that iron concentration in the urinary tract is already very low. So when thinking of treatment options, a provider should be considering iron availability as a possible factor contributing to virulence."

    "text": "Modes of Motility Expressed by CFT073\nThere are generally three modes of motility, hence avenues for virulence, expressed by CFT073 that we are concerned with: swimming, swarming, and biofilm formation. Inhibition of these virulence factors should decrease the likelihood, and if not, severity of infection.\n\nSwimming\nIndependent movement of the cells. The kind of motility we are all familiar with; powered by rotating flagella. This mode of motility is required to swim up the urethra into the bladder, and in severe cases, required to travel up the ureter to the kidneys (Lane et al. 2005).\n\n\nSwarming\nConcerted, multicellular, and energy intense raft-like movement across semi-solid surfaces. Also powered by rotating flagella. Involves quorum sensing. In catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs), swarming motility is oftentimes employed to travel up the catheter into the bladder, though most studies that looked at this possibility used Proteus mirabilis as the model uropathogen. (Jones et al. 2004).\n\n\nBiofilm Formation\nMatrix of extracellular polymeric substances protecting the pathogen from potentially harmful external conditions, facilitating attachment of the colony. Major causative agent of recurrent infections. Attachment is vital since the human bladder is emptied every couple hours, requiring the pathogen to attach itself to the bladder walls for successful infection (Yang et al. 2016).\nIn addition to modifying the availability of extracellular iron, we are also looking at 2 mutants which have different iron acquisition capabilities. ∆tonB has low intracellular iron since the import of iron is compromised with the deletion of a crucial component of the iron acquisition system. ∆fur has high intracellular iron because the repressor is lacking, hence, allowing for as much iron import via systems like TonB-ExbB-ExbD to occur."
